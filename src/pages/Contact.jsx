      "Once you give us the go ahead to move machines in we will be ready to go. In the event that you already have a vendor we can facilitate the change over to meet your convenience to move out. If you need the machines sooner than that we will make it happen. After we agree on an installation date, it shouldn't take more than 4 hours to move the machines in and get them all set up and working.",

    question: "What are your service days and hours?",

The people who re-stock your vending machines are also trained in repairing them. This helps facilitate most machine repairs and ensures that your vending machines are always up and running.",
